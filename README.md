# PacMan-Project
MIT xPro Week 4 Project: PacMan

<p>
For this excercise, we were given this main objective: 
"You are going to control a PacMan image to simulate the PacMan moving across the screen and reversing direction. This exercise will help you learn how to control the Document Object Model or DOM.  (Links to an external site.)This will model how the browser holds information in memory."</p>
